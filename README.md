# OnLlama
Prompt Engineering with Llama 2 & 3
- Learn best practices for prompting and selecting among the Llama 2 & 3 models by using them as a personal assistant to help you complete day-to-day tasks.
- Experiment with advanced prompt engineering techniques, like few-shot prompting to get Llama 2 to classify the sentiment of text messages, and chain-of-thought prompting to solve logic problems.
- Treat Code Llama as a pair programming partner to both learn to write and improve code.
- Promote safe and responsible use of LLMs by having Llama Guard check user prompts and model responses for harmful content.
